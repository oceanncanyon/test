Here comes a marketer knows data!

I am a marketing analyst with 4 years work experience in marketing agency, where I organized off-line campaign and analyzed the outcome.
I then pursue my master in business analytics in USA and focus on data science implemented on marketing.
I conduct machine learning on transactional data, text data and etc. to uncover consumer behavior.
